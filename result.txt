     a)3.4%
     b)improved_matrixProd => 1       , naive_matrixProd => 16,384
     c)improved_matrixProd => .       , naive_matrixProd =>16,384

2)   8*8 blocks=> 2.6    , 32*32  blocks=> 5.1



3) I believe that the cache performance would be worse since integers have the size of 4 bytes and longs have the size of 8 bytes. Program would need to go two times further if we used long data type.
Therefore using long would cause the cache be used inefficiently.
